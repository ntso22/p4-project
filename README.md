Guide for running code:
1. Either download entire folder including csv files, or simply run "download_tickers.r". This will create the csv files.
2. Next run the "markowitz.r" file, since this file generates the "market_portfolio.csv" file used in "Security Market Like.r".
3. Run "Security Market Line.r"

Note that "download-tickers.r" sometimes fails to execute. This is usually fixed by simply rerunning it. This can be bypassed by simply downloading "prices.csv" and "returns.csv" manually.
